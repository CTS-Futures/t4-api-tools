# QtDemo

**QtDemo** is a C++ demo application built with **Qt 6** that showcases real-time market data, exchange/contract pickers, and expiry selection dialogs. It is intended for internal UI prototyping and testing, and is designed to be built and run entirely within **Visual Studio 2022**, with all dependencies managed via **vcpkg**.

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Visual Studio 2022**
  - Include the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
- **vcpkg** (installed and bootstrapped) (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - For the purposes of this demo, you must:
  - git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
  - run the .bat or .sh file
    
  PowerShell (Windows)
  ```
  cd vcpkg
  .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
  ```
  CMD (Windows)
  ```
  cd vcpkg
  bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
  ```
  Bash (Linux, macOS, WSL)
  ```
  cd vcpkg
  ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
  ```
- **Qt**
  - Follow installation instructions: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html
  
    1. **Launch the Qt Maintenance Tool**
  - Located in your Qt installation directory (e.g., `C:\Qt\MaintenanceTool.exe`)

    2. **Add or Remove Components** â†’ **Select your installed Qt version** (e.g., Qt 6.9.0)
    
    3. Under your Qt version, make sure to check:
    
       - `Qt WebSockets`
       - `Qt Network Authorization`
       - `Qt Tools` (if using Designer or windeployqt)
       - `Qt Base` (should already be installed)
    
    4. Also Ensure that the Qt compiler is using msvc (this is compatible with visual studio). MINGW is not compatible with VS.
    5. Click **Next** and complete installation.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies (via vcpkg)

This project relies on the protbuf libraries, all of which are installed using `vcpkg`:
For convenince all .proto files are compiled and in the repo. 
- `protobuf`
- Note: protobuf is reliant on abseil but this should download automatically with the download of protobuf.

Install them like so:
```sh
vcpkg install protobuf
```
- Also, the protobuf installed on vcpkg is an earlier version. Thus, you must compile all .proto files using the install from vcpkg if they need to be recompiled.
- "vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\tools\protobuf" - This should be the path to the protobuf compiler. Feel free to add this to your ENV for easier compilation.
- Follow the README inside of the proto folder at the root of this repo to easily compile the files.
  
## ðŸ§© Integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio

If not already done:

1. Run this in your vcpkg folder to integrate it with Visual Studio:

```sh
./vcpkg integrate install
```

2. This allows Visual Studio to automatically detect and use libraries installed via vcpkg. Necessary for protobufs to access .dll and .lib files.

## Linking Visual Studio to Qt

#### 1. Install the Qt VS Tools Extension

- Open Visual Studio.
- Go to: `Extensions â†’ Manage Extensions`.
- Search for **Qt Visual Studio Tools**.
- Click **Download**, then restart Visual Studio to complete installation.

Alternatively, download from the marketplace:  
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools

---

#### 2. Add Qt to Visual Studio

Once installed:

- Go to: `Extensions â†’ Qt VS Tools â†’ Qt Options`
- Click **Add...**
- Set the following:
  - **Version name:** `Qt 6.9.1`
  - **Path:** `C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64`

Click **OK** to save.

---

#### 3. Configure Your Project

- Right-click your project â†’ **Qt Project Settings**
- Set the **Qt Version** to the one you just added (e.g., `Qt 6.9.1`)
- Optional: adjust **Moc Directory**, **Rcc Directory**, etc. if needed

#### 4. It may be necessary to manually link Qt dependencies if VS doesn't recognize the libraries

Right-click your project â†’ **Properties**, then make these changes under **All Configurations + x64**:


##### âž• C/C++ â†’ General â†’ Additional Include Directories
```
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include\QtCore
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include\QtGui
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include\QtWidgets
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include\QtNetwork
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include\QtNetworkAuth
C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64\include\QtWebSockets
```

#### Config Files
- Within the Cpp folder,
  ```
  mkdir config
  cd config
  touch config.json
  ```
- Use the following template and insert your info:
  ```json
  "websocket": {
    "url": "wss://wss-sim.t4login.com/v1",
    "api": "https://api-sim.t4login.com",

    "firm": "",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass",
    "app_name": "name",
    "app_license": "license",

    "md_exchange_id": "CME_Eq",
    "md_contract_id": "ES",
    "priceFormat": 2
  }


#### Finished
- After linking the required properties and setting up VS to support Qt, the program should run.
- One problem that may occur is that Visual Studio cannot find .lib or .dll files that should be automatically linked with vcpkg. If this occurs, make a copy of the appropriate .dll or .lib files (inside vcpkg\installed\x64-windows) and put them in the same folder as the CPPDemo executable (insde Cpp/CPPDemo/x64/Debug or Release)
- This problem should be temporary.
